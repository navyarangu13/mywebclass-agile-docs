Task Title: Implement Notification System for Upcoming Assignments and Deadlines

User Story: As a student, I want to receive timely notifications for upcoming assignments and deadlines on mywebclass.org so that I can manage my time effectively and submit my work on time.


Description: Description: The task requires implementing a notification system on mywebclass.org for students to receive timely reminders for their upcoming assignments and deadlines. The notification system should be designed to handle changes to assignment deadlines and send updated notifications to students. The system should be accessible from the student dashboard and send notifications based on the student's preferences and settings.
                          The notification messages should include relevant details such as the name of the assignment, due date, and any additional instructions. The system should also be integrated with the assignment tracking system, allowing students to easily mark assignments as complete or update their status.
                           To ensure students submit their work on time, the notification system should also send reminders to students who have not yet completed their assignments as the deadline approaches.
