Constraints: The main constraints for the initiative include limited budget and resources, time constraints, and technical limitations.


Assumptions: It is assumed that the team has the necessary skills and expertise to develop the platform and implement new features. It is also assumed that there will be no major changes in the project scope.


Risks: 

Technical challenges and limitations: The team will conduct automated testing i.e. pytest for unit testing, Playwright for end to end testing, or manual  testing and implement solutions to mitigate any technical issues.
Time constraints: The team will prioritize tasks and allocate resources efficiently to meet the project deadlines.
Budget limitations: The team will explore cost-effective solutions and alternative resources to minimize the project costs.


Dependencies: The initiative is dependent on the availability of resources and the timely completion of tasks by team members.

Team: 
Project Manager: responsible for project management and ensuring timely completion of tasks.
Developers: responsible for designing, coding, and testing new features.
UX/UI Designer: responsible for designing a user-friendly interface.
Quality Assurance Specialist: responsible for testing the platform and ensuring its quality.
